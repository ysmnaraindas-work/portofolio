**Overview**

Analysis of SLA Compliance for Support Tickets in 2023.

---

**Background**

Efficient support ticket handling is a critical factor in maintaining customer satisfaction. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) serves as a performance benchmark to ensure prompt responses and resolutions. However, SLA breaches can occur due to various factors such as ticket priority, agent group performance, and ticket complexity. Frequent SLA violations may erode customer trust and negatively impact overall service quality.

To address these challenges, this project aims to analyze SLA compliance based on first response and resolution times, identify trends and patterns, and pinpoint factors contributing to SLA violations. The insights derived will help optimize the support process, improve team efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

**Objective**

The primary objective is to create an interactive dashboard to visualize SLA compliance, highlight problem areas, and facilitate data-driven decisions for improving support efficiency. The analysis focuses on:
- SLA compliance percentages for first response and resolution times.
- Identifying high SLA violation trends by ticket priority and agent group.
- Evaluating month-to-month SLA compliance trends.
- Analyzing the correlation between ticket priority and resolution time.
- Determining agent groups with the best SLA performance.

**Problem Statement**

Support teams face challenges in:
1. Monitoring SLA compliance effectively.
2. Identifying factors contributing to SLA violations.
3. Comparing SLA adherence across time periods or agent groups.
4. Pinpointing underperforming areas to address inefficiencies.

**Available Data**

The analysis utilizes the "Technical Support Dataset" (2023) containing the following key fields:
- **Ticket Information:** Status, Ticket ID, Priority, Topic, Created Time.
- **Agent Details:** Agent Group, Agent Name, Total Interactions.
- **SLA Metrics:** SLA status for first response and resolution, timestamps for response/resolution.
- **Customer Information:** Country, Product Group, Support Level, Satisfaction Survey.
- **Geographic Data:** Latitude, Longitude.

**Steps Overview**

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**
   The dataset was imported using Pandas and cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and irrelevant columns. Essential preprocessing steps included type conversion for timestamp fields and calculating SLA compliance metrics.

2. **SLA Compliance Analysis**
   Analytical tables were created to evaluate SLA compliance percentages based on ticket attributes like priority, agent group, and month.
   - SLA compliance for first response and resolution times.
   - Factors affecting SLA breaches based on priority and agent group.

3. **Dashboard Development**
   An interactive SLA performance dashboard was built to visualize:
   - **Overall SLA Compliance:** Displays the compliance percentage for first response and resolution times.
   - **Monthly Trends:** Line charts showing SLA performance over months.
   - **Performance by Agent Group:** Bar charts comparing SLA adherence across groups.
   - **Geographic Analysis:** Geo maps displaying SLA performance by region.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Identified months with significant SLA violations.
   - Highlighted underperforming agent groups and ticket categories.
   - Recommended workflow optimizations to improve SLA compliance.

**Conclusion**

The project provides actionable insights into SLA compliance for support tickets. By analyzing key metrics and identifying factors causing SLA violations, the dashboard aids in resource allocation and strategy refinement. Future enhancements could include real-time SLA monitoring and predictive analytics for proactive issue resolution.
